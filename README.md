# TV script generation project

Development of a classification model to predict customers who will have their loan paid off or defaulted. The KNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regression models will be used.

Project built during the course [Machine learning with Python (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python).

## Installation

#### Dependencies
The dependencies to development this project are below:

    pip install scikit-learn

#### User installation
You need to have the jupyter notebook installed, along with numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

    pip install jupyter

## Development
Contributions to the project are welcome. The idea was to test the accuracy of some models of the library ** scikit ** - ** learn ** to classify data about people that will have their loan paid off or defaulted.

This data set refers to previous loans. The Loan_train.csv dataset includes details for 346 customers whose loans have already been paid or have defaulted.
